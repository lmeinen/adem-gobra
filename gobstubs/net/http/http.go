	// The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
	// is read. If the network connection fails or the server
	// terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
	//
	// The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
	// non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
	// a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
	// close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
	// reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
	// not read to completion and closed.
	//
	// The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
	// with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
	//
	// As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
	// on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
	// as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.

// Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of
// the following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect, up to a
// maximum of 10 redirects:
//
//	301 (Moved Permanently)
//	302 (Found)
//	303 (See Other)
//	307 (Temporary Redirect)
//	308 (Permanent Redirect)
//
// An error is returned if there were too many redirects or if there
// was an HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't cause an
// error. Any returned error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error
// value's Timeout method will report true if the request timed out.
//
// When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body.
// Caller should close resp.Body when done reading from it.
//
// Get is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Get.
//
// To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and
// DefaultClient.Do.
//
// To make a request with a specified context.Context, use NewRequestWithContext
// and DefaultClient.Do.
