// KeyAlgorithm is a workaround for jwk.Key being able to contain different
// types of algorithms in its `alg` field.
//
// Previously the storage for the `alg` field was represented as a string,
// but this caused some users to wonder why the field was not typed appropriately
// like other fields.
//
// Ideally we would like to keep track of Signature Algorithms and
// Content Encryption Algorithms separately, and force the APIs to
// type-check at compile time, but this allows users to pass a value from a
// jwk.Key directly
